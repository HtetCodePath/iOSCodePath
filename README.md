Submitted by: Htet Htwe

iOSCodePathPrework is an app that displays three labels, which includes my name, where I attend, and what I want to work as in the future, and then a button that has a logic to change the background color of main by clicking it.

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### Discord
- I like how you can organize different servers into folders.
- The channel system inside each server is well structured and easy to navigate.
- I appreciate the many different ways user can customize.

### Canvas
- I use this app every day, and the calendar feature is incredibly helpful for staying on top of deadlines.
- The assignments tab helps me quickly see how many tasks I have to complete each day.
- The dashboard makes it easy to access all my courses in one place.

### YouTube
- I love the homepage recommendation algorithm since it ensures I always have something interesting to watch.
- The watch history feature is great for revisiting videos I’ve already seen or want to rewatch later.
- The Shorts feature is keeps me entertained, although it sometimes leads to procrastination...

I recently worked on a personal project called BetterWebSchedule, which won 2nd place at a hackathon with my team. It’s a Chrome extension that improves the student class scheduling experience by adding features like dark mode, RateMyProfessors integration, and an AI chatbot for articulation planning. I’m thinking of expanding it into a full mobile app that makes academic planning easier, more personalized, and accessible for community college students.

## Notes

The only challenge I had while doing this assignment was setting up git. For some reason, I really couldn't do it because my computer thinks I'm logged into another account. I will fix this issue in the near future but for now, I uploading my folders in the GitHub website.
